  This project will be made to visualise orbits of the most recent RocketLab satellites that were launched for French company (Kin√©is).
  Those satellites are IoT devices that are supposed to help with not covered by terrestrial networks areas.
    The user will be able to chose the satellite, and even the planet from Solar System where the simulations was supposed to be completed.

  The whole calculator will be made with Python and libraries: MatPlotLib, Numpy, Datetime. Also, I'll add MySQL for the data of satellites.
  Whole project data will be based on the ephemerises, which are the tables that corecctly show how the trajectory of an object is going.

  For the visualisation aspect I choose the library MatPlotLib, because the charts are very visible and clear. 
  When it comes to backend, I'll provide the .sql file that will be exported using mysqldump.
